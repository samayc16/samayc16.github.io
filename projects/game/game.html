		  <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Although I created this project for my programming hardware and software course, I saw it as a novel opportunity to better my C and C++ skills, learn data strcutures within these languages, develop my first game, and gain real-world experience on the Mbed microcontroller. Most of what I want to do in the near future is done in these languages, so I'm glad I was able to learn by creating an interactive game.</p>
		  <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>This project was physically created on a breadboard with an Mbed, a ULCD display, an accelerometer, and three buttons. One is supposed to interact with the game by tilting the breadboard in the direction one wants to move, which is done by reading the accelerometer, and inputting actions through the buttons which you can see in the video above! With this hardware, the software was made incrementally. First, a hashtable data structure was made, since it would hold the positions of the "blocks" on the screen. After a role-playing game was slowly made by creating logic for movement, interactions, checkpoints, and everything else you can see, with additional features such as bonus candy, secret menus, and different difficulties added later to further polish the game.</p>
		  <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>I'm content with the game and don't really have any "<strong>what now?</strong>" plans to add any more features, though I may port this so that it is able to be played on a computer with arrow keys. I'm glad I did this project as it helped me not only deepen my understanding of hardware and software, but it also helped me learn what I like... and sadly it is not videogame development. Though this is unfortunate, it is okay to not like a certain aspect of one's major if it is not appealing to them as long as you learn the concepts behind them!</p>
