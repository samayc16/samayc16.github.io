		  <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>After registering for courses last minute, I had created a schedule in which I would have to walk 30 minutes from my home to class every Monday and Friday morning at 8:00. Reasonably, this was a very dreadful walk, though it provided me time to think of how I could avoid walking this much in the future. I don't own a car, ride-share scooters are expensive, I am afraid of my bike rusting in the rain while I'm in class, and it would be very hard to transport a bulk, electric scooter. Since there were no options that satisfied all of my needs, I decided I would make my own.</p>
		  <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>Putting together this scooter was pretty straightforward... in theory. I purchased an already-collapsible acoustic scooter, a motorized wheel, a battery pack, and a motor controller. I retrofit the motorized wheel to the front of the scooter and attached the controller to the shaft of the scooter. After wiring everything up, I threw the battery into my bookbag, and extended the power input of the controller to the handlebar of the scooter. The battery remains in the bookbag as it deters people from stealing a "dead" electric scooter as it can only be powered by the bookbag. Through this, I was able to create a scooter which hits around 12mph sustained on flat land and has an hour of battery-life!</p>
		  <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>Now that I have a functional protoype, my steps for moving forward include purchasing a larger scooter, as I had purchased the cheapest one which ended up being a youth scooter, so that I may more comfortably ride it. Moreover, I want to retrofit a second motorized wheel so that the scooter can accelerate faster and to higher speeds. Lastly, I'd like to install cable brakes as the current method is electronic, and I'd like a failsafe in case the battery dies or becomes disconnected.</p>
