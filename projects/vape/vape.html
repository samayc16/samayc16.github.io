		  <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>When I was attending high school, the popularity of vaping was skyrocketing as it was seen as a healthier alternative to ciagrettes. Unfortunately, many teenagers, including many of my good friends and peers, saw this as an opportunity to pick up the latest trend and inadvertently gained a nicotine addiction. Along with this, they had also developed an oral fixation which was not dependent on nicotine, but served as another addiction. With this problem, I sought out a way to safely inhale vapor without nicotine to satisfy one's cravings.</p>
		  <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>My water vaporizer is essentially a hand-help humidifier. It uses a piezoelectric disc which uses sound waves to create standing waves in the water which upon touching the surface aerosolize into a mist which resembles vapor. With this theory, I created a circuit which drove the disc, and a demonstration of the vaporization can be seen above! With this circuit, I then created a body to house the circuit and a mouthpiece to house the disc, and with a couple 18650 battery cells, I was able to create a prototype of my water vaporizer.</p>
		  <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>Now that I have a functional protoype, my steps for moving forward include redesigning the entire circuit: I had created this before I had an intermediate understanding of circuits, and having taken that course, I have designed a schematic for a much more efficient circuit. Moreover, I plan on purchasing a new transducing disc which is able to support a higher frequency to create more vapor. Lastly, a new disc can be submerged under the water, unlike the current prototype, which will allow for the creation of a much more compact mouthpiece.</p>
